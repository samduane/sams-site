## Hello, world! {#hello-world}

Welcome to my site! This is where I put my thoughts, photos, and projects for anyone to enjoy. In general, I like to spend most of my time thinking about how technology fits into the Garden of Eden/New Jerusalem and attempting to construct a biblical world view from the foundations of Scripture, rather than my own biases and cultural upbringing. I tend to put an emphasis on doxology, focusing on how I can translate biblical truths to real world action.

Additionally, I put my different hobbies and projects such as photography and programming on here to inspire and encourage others to appreciate the life Jesus has given us, embrace the creative nature we possess as reflections of God's Image, and to lead by example in showing that the life of Christ can be expressed through action in everything we do!
