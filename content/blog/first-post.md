# Hello, world!
Welcome to my site! This is where I put my thoughts, photos, and projects for anyone to enjoy. In general, I like to spend most of my time thinking about how technology fits into the Garden of Eden/New Jerusalem and attempting to construct a biblical world view from the foundations of Scripture, rather than my own biases and cultural upbringing. I tend to put an emphasis on doxology, focusing on how I can translate biblical truths to real world action.
