"On God rests my salvation and my glory;<br />
my mighty rock, my refuge is God."<br />
<p><strong>Psalm 62:7</strong><br /></p>

<h2 id="knowledge-without-wisdom">Knowledge without Wisdom</h2>
<p>  Does anyone else ever marvel that we are currently living in the future?
We live in a time with drones and robots, virtual reality, electric cars and
the knowledge of the world at our fingertips. And yet, with all of this the
Truth is just as murky and unclear from when we first created bricks. With
everything that we have, you would imagine we would be even a <strong>single</strong> step closer
to understanding the fundamental existential questions of human existence.</p>
<p>  Why are we here? What are we here to do? Who are we? The world
fails to answer these seemingly simple questions. Darwinists say everything is an
accident. Buddhists say we need to disconnect from all of reality. Taoists claim
we must follow &ldquo;The Way&rdquo;. And this issue persists on the Theistic side as well.
Catholics claim you must work your way to heaven. Muslims follow the teaching of
Muhhammad as the great messenger of Allah. Hinduism gives you a large swath of
deities to choose from.</p>
<h2 id="jesus-is-the-truth">Jesus is the Truth</h2>
<p>  As followers of Christ, we know the answer. And we know that the world has
been divided in its attempt to resist God at every turn. We know that these
different faiths are designed to put man on top, and make God a puppet or a
fairy tale. So, why is it that the church is just as divided in its beliefs, if
not more so?</p>
<h3 id="jesus-as-our-truth">Jesus as <em>our</em> Truth</h3>
<p>  I think the answer is simple. The reason the church is just as divided is
the same reason as all the worldly religions. The church, in many regards, is
treating Jesus as a puppet or a fairy tale. We aren&rsquo;t treating Jesus as the
bedrock foundation of our lives. We don&rsquo;t treat Him like the
God-Man who looked His apostles in the eyes and breathed the Words of Life that
lead to our salvation. We look at Scripture as a rule book, maybe a collection
of old wives tales with good morals. Do you?</p>
<p>  Maybe you sincerely believe Jesus is who He says He is. And yet, your life looks the same. You&rsquo;ve added Jesus to
your collection of personal convictions, but haven&rsquo;t re-evaluated your other beliefs in light of your new faith. In
other words, you&rsquo;ve added Jesus on top of your existing beliefs. He is not your Rock. He&rsquo;s just another add-on.</p>
<h3 id="our-idea-of-the-church"><em>Our</em> idea of the church</h3>
<p>  I believe that it is this flawed reasoning that has lead to the many
struggles in the church. When Christians look to follow Christ, yet don&rsquo;t rely
on Him as the foundation to build on, what happens? What you will find are
different &ldquo;versions&rdquo; of Christianity that have similar concepts, with strange
twists.</p>
<p>  You&rsquo;ll see pastors try to be <em>hip</em> and <em>cool</em>, with ripped skinny jeans and
velvet blazers in order to appeal to the world. Worship becomes transformed from the
communal praise of a glorious God to a flashy concert with colorful lights and
empty lyrics, desiring to appease a younger generation raised in a culture that
prioritizes pleasure and experience. Sermons become TED talks and comedy
routines. Spreading the good news becomes a numbers game. The church is no
longer a community, but a business.</p>
<h3 id="leaning-on-our-own-understanding">Leaning on <em>our</em> own understanding</h3>
<p>  And others see the problem, but rather than turn to God they turn to their
own explanations. Men bestowed with the gift of teaching are raised on pillars
to become new idols. The Word is not sufficient, but must be understood through
the teachings of Calvin, or Luther, or whoever seems closest to our own
understanding of the Word. Pastors are lifted up as priests, given authority by
man. Love and mercy are squeezed dry as we systematically amalgamate the Word
with our own views and preconceptions.</p>
<p>  These different denominations may look fairly different externally, yet
internally rely on the same foundation. Not the foundation of faith, but the
foundation of man. Each denomination is an attempt to reconcile personal views
with Scripture, attempting to redefine the Lord&rsquo;s Word in a way that preserves
our own values.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>  The solution to this problem is quite clear. Make Jesus your Rock. Take off
the rose tinted glasses you use to read Scripture. Make Scripture the glasses
through which you view the world. Look to understand what God meant in His Word,
rather than what you <strong>think</strong> it means. Pray that God will make you view the
world as He does, rather than working to make God see the world the way you do.
Ask yourself, &ldquo;Do I believe this because the Word said so, or because I think so?&rdquo;</p>
