"For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God.<br />
Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God,<br />
which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words."<br />
<p><strong>1 Corinthians 2:11-13</strong><br /></p>
</div>
<h2 id="controlling-your-tongue">Controlling your tongue</h2>
<p>  When we think of the value in seasoning our words with light, our first thought is the removal of profanity. While
this is a good start for the Christian in their infancy, most believers never grow beyond this rudimentary stage. We
never consider the value of the terminology used in our day to day lives. As the church continues to adopt worldly
rhetoric, the postmodernist concepts associated with these words seep deeper into the heart of the Body.</p>
<p>  Such phrases as &ldquo;empowered by the Spirit&rdquo; and &ldquo;influencer for Christ&rdquo; appear harmless at first glance. However, when
these phrases are further investigated, it becomes clear these are far more dangerous than their initial impression
implies. Like a trojan horse, these words act as gift wrapped traps designed to sneak enemy idealogies into the minds of
God&rsquo;s people. To better understand what&rsquo;s going on, we need to first understand the role of language.</p>
<h2 id="language-and-ideology">Language and Ideology</h2>
<p>  Language is at its core, a method of communicating ideas. Words have particular meanings, ideas with certain
associations to the world. We combine these words to compose new ideas that elaborate on old ones. On its own, language
is a method of information exchange. However, there are many languages, from many nations and many cultures. These
different nations and cultures have their own world views. And they use language to communicate these world views. This
is where the problem lies.</p>
<p>  When we adopt worldly rhetoric, we are also adopting the worldview these words are based on. The words meaning is
<strong>derived</strong> from the world view. Terminology is built on the foundation of the world view it is attempting to describe.
Even though the church does not agree with these idealogies, adopting this language also adopts these beliefs, even if
it is not intentional. This has lead to the perversion of the church, guiding Christ&rsquo;s followers away into the arms of
the world, from life into death.</p>
<h3 id="christian-influencers">Christian influencers</h3>
<p>  To give an example, let&rsquo;s look at the aforementioned phrase, &ldquo;influencer of Christ&rdquo;. On its face,
it seems entirely fine. What&rsquo;s there to worry about? Somebody is trying to influence the world for Christ. Isn&rsquo;t that&hellip;
good? Well yes, but not according to the ideological assumptions that the term &ldquo;influencer&rdquo; implies. When we look at the
original use of this phrase, we see that it is orginally intended, and continues to be used, to describe people with
large followings, power, and money. Successful in the eyes of the world, these &ldquo;influencers&rdquo; are called to a higher
expectation of how they live. This itself isn&rsquo;t wrong, but it doesn&rsquo;t capture the full picture of how Christ calls us to
live.</p>
<h4 id="the-kernel-of-truth">The kernel of truth</h4>
<p>  As with any good lie, the idea of an &ldquo;influencer&rdquo; is based on a kernel of truth. In Matthew 25, Jesus tells the
parable of the talents. That each servant is expected to make good with what he has been given, and to return more than
he was given. In the same way, those given power, money, and fame in the church are expected to use these gifts to
further glorify our Lord. Those who are given 5 talents should be expected to make more than those given 2 talents. In
this sense the term &ldquo;influencer&rdquo; appears reasonable. However, there are two problems. The first is that, as I have just shown,
God in His Word has already provided the words needed to communicate this truth. In this case, we can point to the
parable of the talents rather than using the term &ldquo;influencer&rdquo;. Secondly, adopting this term has unintended
consequences.</p>
<h4 id="the-lies">The lies</h4>
<p>  While &ldquo;influencer&rdquo; portrays the importance of serving Christ with all that we have been given, there are additional
assumptions that are not founded in Scripture. For one, it puts the emphasis on worldly success rather than spiritual
success. We are putting the focus of &ldquo;Christian influencers&rdquo; on their popularity and worldly prosperity, rather than on their faith
and fearful teaching of the Word. We end up turning spiritual leaders into worldly celebrities.</p>
<p>  Another consequence of this terminology is that we end up redefining the very definition of a Christian. We change
the expectations for what a follower of Christ is called to do. Consider that the very title &ldquo;Christian influencer&rdquo;
implies that a Christian on their own is <strong>not</strong> an influencer. That is, the term &ldquo;Christian influencer&rdquo; separates the
role of influencing the world from the role of following Christ. You can be a Christian, without being an influencer.
Yet, Jesus claims that,</p>
<div class="verse">
"All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.<br />
Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,<br />
teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”<br />
<p><strong>Matthew 28:18-20</strong><br /></p>
</div>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>  The words we use are important. Language is a powerful tool to describe the world and our own minds. This
relationship goes two ways, and can change the way we think and view the world. With this power we must be wise and discerning to
use it in a way that honors God and points to Christ. We must be diligent in leaning on God&rsquo;s Word rather than our own
understanding. God has provided us everything we need to describe His creation and the new life He has given us. As
followers of Christ we should strive to speak, &ldquo;not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit,
combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.&rdquo;</p>
